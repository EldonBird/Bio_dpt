# Bio_dpt

##  C++ library

The purpose of this branch is to convert our code into c++ so that we can make a library out of it.
I am going to say there are more rules that I would like to follow with this(Hunter).

NO BUILDING THE PROJECT!!!!

If you need to test build it that is cool but dont push a built project to github, it could ruin someone's work inside the project. 
We will pick a day to build and update the function, but otherwise feel free to push your code to this branch or another.




project commands (mainly for Hunter)

* python setup.py build_ext --inplace
* cmake --build . (please only build inside the src\build.)
